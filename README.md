# e.primes

this was a code challenge..

# give xth y digit prime in the expanse of e



query is a script that returns the xth y digit prime in e.

e10000 is e calculated out to 10000 decimal digits

e1mil is e calculated out to 1 million decimal degits

ecalc.py is a script to calculate e

mkprimes.py is a script to generate primes

primefinder.py is a script that scans through a file based on a length of digit value and tests for prime numbers.
    it is terribly inefficient for larger numbers. I piped the output to a file. 

cleanup.py is a script to remove 0,1, and any line starting with a 0 from primefinder.py's output
